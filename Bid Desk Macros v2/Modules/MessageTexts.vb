    Public Const CiscoDRType As String = "Hi, in your ticket request you've asked for Deal Registration for which there are two alternatives from Cisco:

1) Hunting: This is for situations in which you have pro-actively identified an opportunity and are bringing it to Cisco. This could be for customers who have previously used other vendors, or alternatively are trying a new portion of the Cisco portfolio.

2) Teaming: This is for opportunities on which you're collaborating with Cisco, having landed and expanded a customer into new opportunities this is intended to reward the joint work that you have put in with a named Cisco Account Manager.

I have attached the two alternative questionnaires that apply to these two scenarios to the ticket, and will apply for pricing based on your response.

There are further discounts available based on things like our pre-sales (time) investments, so please reach out if neither of the above scenarios applies and we'll work out which discounts are most appropriate for your opportunity."
